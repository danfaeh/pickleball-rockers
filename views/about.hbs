An Octogenarian introduce me to this game who happens to be a Senior Olympic Champion, if he can play this game four days a week why can't I  just pick up a paddle in my 50's? I was hooked!! However spending 7 out of my 12 months of playing injured what's a girl to do but create Pickleball Rockers! With love of Art and Pickleball, I've started designing personalized logos with Peter Pickles traveling internationally. I'm happy to design your team logo with your state in mind, or favorite pastime.</p>
